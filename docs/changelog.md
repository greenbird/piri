# Version 1.0.1

## Features

* removes bad part of documentation


# Version 1.0.0 Release: Piri Reis

The first release focuses on key mapping functionality. We believe that is finding values from different places and combining them to one. Setting default values, Casting values, and applying if statements. This should suffice for a lot of usecases where one need to transform json into structurally different json.

## Features

* Mapping with configuration File.
* Combine multiple values to one.
* Default values
* If statements
    * is, contains, not
* casting
    * integer, decimal, iso date
